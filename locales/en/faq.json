      "q": "What is Inception Studio Capital?",
      "a": "We’re a venture fund backing experienced AI founders from day zero. We built Inception Studio, the most selective founder community in Silicon Valley, specifically to attract high-quality repeat entrepreneurs who avoid traditional accelerators. {{foundersParticipated}} founders have participated, {{repeatFounders}} are repeat founders, and {{repeatFoundersWithExit}} have prior successful exits."
    },
    {
      "q": "What makes your access unique?",
      "a": "Our zero-equity retreats eliminate adverse selection—the best founders join because there’s no downside. We build trust before investing, so we consistently secure early allocation with MFN and pro-rata rights. We see and invest in companies at formation stage, often pre-product, getting privileged access other investors can’t access."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do you deploy capital?",
      "a": "First money in. Double down on the ones that take off. ~$100k starter checks in ~40 companies at incorporation (1–2% target ownership), then $500k–$1.5M core positions in ~12 companies with strong traction (2.5–10% ownership). We secure MFN and pro-rata rights on every investment to follow our winners."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who are the General Partners?",
      "a": "John Whaley: Stanford PhD (Best Thesis Award), MIT undergrad, Forbes AI 50, teaches at Stanford CS. Serial entrepreneur with 3 companies including UnifyID. Mike Morris: 28-year Silicon Valley veteran with 3 acquisitions + 1 IPO, early at VMware. Combined 50+ years of experience building and scaling AI companies."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the fund terms?",
      "a": "10-year term (with up to two 1-year extensions), 2% management fee, 20% carry, $250K minimum commitment, 25% initial capital call. We focus exclusively on AI-native companies."
    },
    {
      "q": "What kind of founders do you attract?",
      "a": "Experienced technical founders: {{repeatFounders}} repeat entrepreneurs, {{repeatFoundersWithExit}} with prior successful exits, {{averageIndustryExperience}}+ years average industry experience, {{founderNps}} NPS score, {{founderReferralRate}} referred by other founders. These are founders who would never join traditional accelerators but value our zero-equity model for co-founder matching and focused environment."
    },
    {
      "q": "What portfolio results have you achieved?",
      "a": "{{numberCompaniesRaised}} companies founded through Inception have raised {{companiesTotalRaised}}+ in follow-on funding. Notable outcomes include: Mem0 ($20M Series A), Ventrilo ($10M from a16z), Coframe ($9M from Khosla), and Alex AI (acquired by OpenAI in August 2025). Multiple companies achieving significant valuation increases."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why do experienced founders choose Inception?",
      "a": "They face unique challenges: highly selective about co-founders, networks may have aged out, traditional accelerators don’t make sense (7% for $125K?), and they need a deadline to get started. Our 3-day zero-equity retreats solve these problems while providing community, advisory, recruiting, and fundraising support."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the relationship between Inception Studio and Inception Studio Capital?",
      "a": "Inception Studio is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that runs zero-equity 3-day retreats for experienced AI founders. The nonprofit takes no equity and charges no fees—it exists purely to help founders start their next company. Inception Studio Capital is a separate for-profit venture fund that invests in companies formed through the program. This separation is critical: because the nonprofit takes zero equity, it eliminates adverse selection and attracts the highest-quality founders who would never join traditional accelerators."
